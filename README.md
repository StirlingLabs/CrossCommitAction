# ðŸ”€ Cross Commit Action

> Synchronises parts of repositories. Typical usage is for synchronizing to GitOps state repositories from source code.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

```yaml
steps:
- name: Commit to state repository
  uses: StirlingLabs/CrossCommitAction@v21.07.0
  with:
    source-folder: config
    destination-repository: https://<user>:${{ secrets.user_token }}@github.com/org/dest-repo
    destination-folder: .
    destination-branch: alpha
    git-commit-message: "Custom commit message"
    git-commit-sign-off: "false"
    excludes: |
      README.md
      .git
      path/deeper/in/the/repo
```

The example above will trigger `rsync` that will synchronize the files in
`./config` to repository `github.com/org/dest-repo` root using user credentials
(can be stored as Github secrets) and create commit on `alpha` branch. The
`rsync` will exclude `/.git`, `/README.md` and `/path/deeper/in/the/repo` from
both repositories during the synchronization.
